    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Considered by some as the pride of Filipino cuisine, <strong>Pork Adobo</strong> is definitely a favorite
        among many around the world. For this, we cook pork slices in a perfect mix of soy sauce,
        vinegar, and garlic to make this savory and sour viand. And I’ve got to say, it’s definitely
        a great way to introduce the world to what Pinoy cooks can make! But actually, there are
        other renditions of adobo.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork belly – For a juicy, meaty dish!</li>
        <li>Garlic – Makes for the most savory stew.</li>
        <li>Dried bay leaves – Gives off the perfect adobo aroma</li>
        <li>Vinegar – Part of what makes adobo so brilliantly unique is its sourness, which we get from vinegar.</li>
        <li>Soy sauce – There’s nothing quite like the salty quality of soy sauce!</li>
        <li>Peppercorn – Just for the slightest bit of spice!</li>
        <li>Water – As this has a stew, we will definitely be using plenty of water!</li>
        <li>Salt – And to make sure everything is nice and flavorful, you will be using some salt too.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the pork belly, soy sauce, and garlic then marinade for at least 1 hour</li>
        <li>Heat the pot and put-in the marinated pork belly. Cook this all up for a few minutes</li>
        <li>Pour the remaining marinade including the garlic.</li>
        <li>Add water, whole peppercorn, and dried bay leaves. Then bring your mixture to a boil. Simmer for 40 minutes to 1 hour</li>
        <li>Put the vinegar inside and simmer for 12 to 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste</li>
        <li><em>Serve hot. Share and enjoy!</em></li>
    </ol>
