    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Ramen</strong> is a Japanese noodle soup dish adapted from Chinese noodles, consisting of wheat noodles
        in a savory broth, often topped with sliced meat, vegetables, and a boiled egg. While it has roots
        in China, ramen has become a distinctly Japanese dish with many regional variations and is a popular,
        inexpensive meal.
